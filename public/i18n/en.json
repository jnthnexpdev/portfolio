When a vehicle malfunctioned, coordinators created detailed reports with <strong>descriptions and photos</strong>, which mechanical workshops reviewed to propose diagnostics, estimated repair times, and a <strong>preliminary budget</strong>. Once approved, the vehicle was assigned to a workshop, where technicians documented each step through a <strong>timeline with images and progress updates</strong>. The platform also generated <strong>delivery receipts</strong> once the vehicle was fully repaired and validated by CFE. All initial vehicle information was imported via <strong>CSV files</strong>, and every repair record was stored in organized folders to maintain a complete <strong>historical archive of each vehicle</strong>.",

The system also managed all core <strong>thesis information</strong>, including title, status, and the requirement to upload their <strong>published academic article</strong>.\n\nEach user type —coordinator, professor, and student— had a personalized dashboard: the coordinator accessed global system stats; professors saw only their advisees; and students managed all information related to their thesis. All users had a full <strong>profile module</strong> where they could edit personal data and update their password.\n\nOnce a thesis was approved by the professor, the coordinator used an administrative panel to validate the work or return it for revision.
